# 🎉 Event Center Website | HTML & CSS Project

Welcome to the **Event Center Website** – a multi-page responsive website built with pure **HTML** and **CSS**. This project showcases essential web development skills including semantic HTML, layout styling, responsive design, and user interface elements like forms and tables.

## 📌 Overview
